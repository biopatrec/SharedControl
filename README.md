# Shared Control Systems #
This project is an implementation of the shared control integration framework to allow communication between BioPatRec as a signal acquisition and user control platform with ArduPilot for vehicular control. The project consists of several parts:

### BioPatRec ###
The communication layer between BioPatRec and the ArduPilot autopilot platform

### Avoidance ###
Collision Avoidance/Shared Control system to augment the safety and controllability of user control

### Rangefinder ###
A low-cost, custom-built laser rangefinder for determining vehicle height (only applies when using a Quadcopter)
